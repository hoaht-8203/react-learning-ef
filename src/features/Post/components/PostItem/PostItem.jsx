                <p>The employee girl was super nice :) she explained how to best eat my meal when I got my food. There was construction going on right by the wall I was sitting on 1st floor. The employee apologized and asked me if O want to move. So kind and attentive. Even after the meal she made sure I was okay to go because it was raining. 110% recommend!!</p>
